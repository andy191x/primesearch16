# PrimeSearch16

Linear-time (O(n)) iterator capable of producing up to 65535 positions in pseudorandom order.

This implementation is based on prime number modulus commonly found in LCGs. The purpose of this utility is to "randomly" iterate through a small/medium set quickly, without duplicating the set. **It should only be used in novelty applications**. The output stream is not cryptographically secure.
